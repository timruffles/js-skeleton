js-skeleton
===========

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2015

This is a template project showing how to build a Javascript web-app using `js_of_ocaml`, `TyXML` and `React`.


Instructions
------------

You'll need the [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager.
It should be available through your distribution (`brew install opam` on OSX), but you can use a [generic opam binary](http://tools.ocaml.org/opam.xml) if it's missing or too old (I use opam 1.2).


Install dependencies:

    opam install tyxml reactiveData js_of_ocaml

Build:

    make

To run, open `index.html` in a browser.

All the code is in `main.ml` and is well commented.
